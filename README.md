# 👋 Hi, I'm Desiree

**Front-End Developer** passionate about building responsive, accessible, and user-first websites. I combine creativity with clean code to craft seamless digital experiences that not only look great but work beautifully across devices.

## 💡 About Me

With a background in **Media and Marketing**, I bring a storytelling mindset to every line of code. I love working at the intersection of **design and development**, ensuring the user journey is intuitive and engaging from start to finish. My focus is front-end, but I’ve also worked across the stack on projects with **Python** and **Django**, giving me a strong grasp of how the front and back end work together.

I’m currently diving deeper into **JavaScript** (and getting ready to tackle **React**) to build even more interactive web interfaces.
